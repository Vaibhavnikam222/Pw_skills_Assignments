    "1. Covariance:-Covariance measures the degree to which two random variables change together. It quantifies the extent to which the values of one variable tend to increase or decrease in relation to the values of the other variable.\n",
    "2. Correlation:- Correlation is a standardized measure that quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It's designed to be scale-invariant and falls within the range of -1 to 1, with 0 indicating no linear correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Range:-\n",
    "1.  Covariance can take any real value, both positive and negative. The magnitude of covariance is not standardized.\n",
    "2.  Correlation values are bounded between -1 and 1, making them easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Units:-\n",
    "1. Covariance: The units of covariance are the product of the units of the two variables.\n",
    "2. Correlation:-Correlation is a unitless measure, which means it's not affected by the units or scales of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Scaling:-\n",
    "1. Covariance:-Covariance is sensitive to the scale of the variables. Therefore, it's challenging to compare covariances between datasets with different units or scales.\n",
    "2. Corelation:- Correlation allows for easier comparison between datasets with different units or scales, making it a more robust measure for assessing the strength and direction of linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measures used in statistical analysis:-**\n",
    "1. Covariance: Covariance is used to understand how two variables vary together. It is often used for exploratory data analysis. However, its sensitivity to scale makes it less suitable for comparing the strength of relationships between different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Correlation: Correlation, particularly Pearson's correlation coefficient, is widely used for assessing linear relationships between variables. It's valuable for quantifying the strength and direction of the relationship in a standardized way. Other correlation coefficients, like Spearman's rank correlation, are used when variables may not have a linear relationship but have a monotonic one."
