    "Descriptive statistics involve methods and techniques for summarizing and describing data in a meaningful way. They provide a clear and concise representation of data, allowing us to understand its main features. Common descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (e.g., standard deviation, range).\n",

Inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
