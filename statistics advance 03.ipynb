    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used in the field of inferential statistics to make decisions or draw conclusions about populations based on sample data. It involves formulating a hypothesis, collecting data, and then using statistical techniques to determine whether the data provides enough evidence to support or reject the hypothesis. The two primary types of hypotheses in hypothesis testing are the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (Ha).\n",

Hypothesis testing provides a systematic and evidence-based way to make these decisions.

    "### characteristics of the t-distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shape:** The t-distribution has a bell-shaped, symmetric probability density function similar to the normal distribution (bell curve), but with heavier tails. This means that it has more probability mass in the tails compared to the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Location and Scale:** Like the normal distribution, the t-distribution is centered at zero. The spread or width of the distribution is determined by the degrees of freedom (df). As df increases, the t-distribution approaches the shape of the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Degrees of Freedom:** The degrees of freedom (df) parameter in the t-distribution specifies the shape of the distribution and plays a critical role. It represents the number of independent observations available for estimating a statistic. Larger df values lead to distributions that closely resemble the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use the t-Distribution:\n",
    "1. Small Sample Sizes: When we have a small sample size (typically less than 30)\n",
    "2. When the population standard deviation is unknown\n",
    "3. Confidence Intervals: When constructing confidence intervals for population parameters (e.g., mean or proportion) based on sample data, the t-distribution is used to account for uncertainty due to small sample sizes.\n",
    "4. In hypothesis testing, especially when comparing sample means, the t-distribution is employed to determine the statistical significance of observed differences.\n"
