    "### Differences:\n",
    "### 1. Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Used when categories have an inherent order or ranking.\n",
    "2. Assigns unique integer values based on the order or rank of categories.\n",
    "3. Suitable for features like education levels or ratings.\n",
    "4. Preserves the ordinal relationship between categories.\n",
    "5. Encodes data with meaningful numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Used when categories have no inherent order or ranking.\n",
    "2. Assigns unique integer labels to categories without considering order.\n",
    "3. Suitable for nominal features like colors or product names.\n",
    "4. Treats all categories as equally important.\n",
    "5. Encodes data with arbitrary numeric values for distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Choose One Over the Other:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose Ordinal Encoding when there is a clear order or ranking among the categories, and this order is important for our analysis. For example, in cases like education levels, we want the model to understand that \"Master's\" is higher than \"Bachelor's.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose Label Encoding when there is no meaningful order among the categories, and we only need to represent them as distinct numerical values. For nominal categories like colors or product names, Label Encoding is suitable because it doesn't introduce any artificial ranking."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a feature encoding technique used for categorical variables in a machine learning project. It's especially useful when we have a categorical feature with a large number of categories and we want to convert it into a numerical format that preserves the relationship between the categories and the target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean (or other aggregation) of the target variable for each category in the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Order the categories based on their mean values, from lowest to highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encode the categories with ordinal values reflecting their mean-based order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "We are working on a project to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. One of the features in your dataset is \"Contract Type,\" which can take values like \"Month-to-Month,\" \"One Year,\" and \"Two Year.\" This feature has a clear ordinal relationship because customers with longer contract durations tend to have lower churn rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We calculate the mean churn rate for each contract type:\n",
    "\"Month-to-Month\" contract has a mean churn rate of 0.42.\n",
    "\"One Year\" contract has a mean churn rate of 0.12.\n",
    "\"Two Year\" contract has a mean churn rate of 0.02.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Based on these means, you assign ordinal values:\n",
    "\"Month-to-Month\" gets assigned 1.\n",
    "\"One Year\" gets assigned 2.\n",
    "\"Two Year\" gets assigned 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We replace the original \"Contract Type\" column with these ordinal values."

    "### A.Gender (Binary Categorical Variable - Male/Female):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encoding Method: Use Label Encoding or Binary Encoding.\n",

    "Label Encoding: If our machine learning algorithm can handle ordinal values, we can use label encoding, where we assign 0 to one category (e.g., Male) and 1 to the other (e.g., Female). This method maintains the ordinality but might imply an artificial order.\n",
    "\n",

    "### B. Education Level (Nominal Categorical Variable - High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encoding Method: Use One-Hot Encoding.\n",
    "2. Explanation:\n",
    "Education levels have no inherent order, and each level is distinct. One-hot encoding creates a binary column for each category, where 1 represents the presence of that category and 0 represents its absence. This method preserves the nominal nature of the variable and avoids introducing artificial rankings.\n",

    "### C. Employment Status (Nominal Categorical Variable - Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encoding Method: Use One-Hot Encoding.\n",
    "2. Explanation:\n",
    "Like education status, employment status is also nominal, with no natural order among categories. Therefore, one-hot encoding is appropriate for the same reasons mentioned above. It ensures that each category is treated as a separate, non-ordinal entity."
