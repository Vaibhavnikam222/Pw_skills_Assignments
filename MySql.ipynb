    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and management of data. It serves as a central repository for storing and managing various types of information, making it possible to store, retrieve, update, and delete data in a systematic and structured manner."

    "Differentiation between SQL and NoSQL databases-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "Use a tabular structure to store data.Data is organized into rows and columns.Each column has a specific data type.Relationships between tables are established using foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "Use various data models such as key-value, document, column-family, and graph.Data is stored in a more flexible and dynamic format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases: Have a fixed schema that defines the structure of tables and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:Can be schema-less or schema-flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Query Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "Use the structured query language for data querying and manipulation.\n",
    "SQL offers powerful querying capabilities, including complex joins, aggregation functions, and data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "Use various query languages or APIs depending on the specific database and data model.Query languages might be more simplistic compared to the rich querying capabilities of SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Transactions and Consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "Generally offer strong ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.Ensures data consistency even in the case of failures or concurrent updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "Might offer eventual consistency rather than strict consistency.Sacrifices some level of consistency for improved scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "Traditional SQL databases are often vertically scalable.Horizontal scalability might require more complex setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "Designed for horizontal scalability from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "Well-suited for applications where structured data, complex querying, and transactional integrity are important.Commonly used in financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and relational data scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "Ideal for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.Suitable for applications like social media, content management, real-time analytics, and IoT.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "MongoDB (document), Cassandra (column-family), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph)."
