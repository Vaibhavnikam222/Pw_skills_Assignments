    "The technique of removing data and information from websites is called web scraping. It involves automatically obtaining information from online sites, frequently arranging unstructured data so that it may be examined, saved, or applied to a variety of applications. Web scraping is frequently carried out with the aid of automated scripts or software programs, also known as \"web scrapers\" or \"web crawlers.\n",

    "Methods used for Web scrapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.APIs: Some websites offer APIs which allow us to access and retrieve data in a structured format. Using APIs is a more reliable and ethical way to obtain data, as it's the method the website owners intend for data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Manual Copy-Pasting:It involves manually copying and pasting data from web pages into a spreadsheet or text document. It's suitable for small-scale scraping tasks but not practical for large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.HTML Parsing Libraries: HTML parsing libraries, such as Beautiful Soup (for Python) and jsoup (for Java), provide tools to navigate and extract data from HTML documents. These libraries create a structured representation of the HTML which make it easier to locate and extract specific elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Web Scraping Frameworks: Frameworks like Scrapy (for Python) provide a comprehensive solution for web scraping. They offer features such as request management, asynchronous scraping, and data processing pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.XPath: XPath is a query language used to navigate XML and HTML documents. It provides a way to traverse the document's structure and select specific elements for extraction. Libraries like lxml (for Python) support XPath-based scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Regular Expressions: Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match and extract specific text from HTML source code. This method is powerful but can become complex and error-prone when dealing with complex HTML structures."

    "**Beautiful Soup:-** It is a Python library used for web scraping purposes. It provides tools to parse HTML and XML documents, navigate their elements, and extract data in a structured and easy-to-use manner. Beautiful Soup is particularly popular for its simplicity and flexibility when working with web scraping tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Beautiful Soup, we send the HTML content of a webpage to the Beautiful Soup library, which then creates a NavigableTree. From there, we can use Beautiful Soup's methods to navigate, search, and extract data from the parsed document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**reasons for using Beautiful Soup:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Parsing: Beautiful Soup allows us to parse HTML and XML documents, converting them into a navigable, structured format that can be easily traversed and manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Tag Navigation: Beautiful Soup provides methods to navigate the document's structure using tags. We can move through the document's hierarchy, access child and parent elements, and search for specific tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Searching and Filtering:to search for specific elements based on tag names, attributes, and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Simple API: Beautiful Soup's API is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. We don't need to have an in-depth understanding of HTML or XML to start using it effectively.\n",
